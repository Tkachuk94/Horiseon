# Horiseon

Horiseon is a test website to further show proper use of semantics within the HTML5 language.

My goal for this project was to provide evidence of my ability to correctly sematics in html
while keeping everything as organized and fuctioning as I can for other users to be able to
add their own spin on things!

Optimization

Seperated and added comments between sections

Corrected Divs to Semantic Elements.

Changed img Links to correctly show images
